# EXCEL 101

## Excel components

### Cell  
* The “squares” in a spreadsheet; the intersection of a row and a column in Excel; where the data goes.  
* Each cell has an address/name defined by its row (numbers) and column (letters).  A1 refers to the cell in the upper left hand corner of the page.  

### Column
* The set of vertical cells
* Identified by a letter

### Row
* A set of horizontal cells
* Identified by a number

### Worksheet
* What we usually think of as a spreadsheet
* The pages, or tabs, within an Excel file

### Workbook
* An Excel file
* A workbook contains at least one (and possibly more) worksheets 

## Basic functions

### Entering data – select a cell and start typing.

### Selecting cells
* A single cell – click on it
* A single column – click on its “letter” name at the top of the worksheet
* A single row – click on its “number name at the left of the worksheet
* Entire worksheet – click on the square above row “1” and to the left of column “A”
* A set of cells – click on the cell in the upper left of the area to select and hold down the left mouse button.  Drag the cursor to the cell in the lower right of the area to select and let go of the mouse button.  You are done.

### Deleting cells
* A single cell – select it and right click.  
* If you want to delete the value in the cell, select “Clear Contents”.
* If you want to delete the cell, select “Delete…”. Excel will then ask you what to do with the cells around the deleted cell.
* A single column – select its letter “name” and right click.  Select “Delete”.
* A single row – select its number “name” and right click.  Select “Delete”.
* Entire worksheet – click on the square above row “1” and to the left of column “A” and right click.  Select “Delete”.
* A group of cells - click on the cell in the upper left of the area to select and hold down the left mouse button.  Drag the cursor to the cell in the lower right of the area to select , let go of the left mouse button and right click.  Select “Delete…”. Excel will then ask you what to do with the cells around

### Sorting – place your cursor within the data to be sorted.  Sort is available on the tool bar (at the top of the worksheet) or if you right click in the selected cell.  Select ascending or descending.

## Basic math

All calculations start with the equal “=” sign.  That’s how Excel knows to calculate.

* Addition -- =A1+B1; for more than two operators, =A1+B1+C1…
* Subtraction -- =A1-B1; for more than two operators, =A1-B1-C1…
* Multiplication -- =A1*B1; for more than two operators, =A1*B1*C1…
* Division -- =A1/B1; for more than two operators, =A1/B1/C1…
* Mixing operators – it’s OK, but just make sure you understand how the math will work;  =A1+B2*C12/H14-D3
* Sum – add an entire column of numbers. =sum(A1:An), where A1 is the first value in the column and An is the last value in the column

## Basic descriptive statistics

### Average
Mean; the sum of a set of values divided by the number of values in the set
=AVERAGE(A1:An) or =AVERAGE(A1,A2,A3,…An)

### Median
Middle value in a range of numbers
=MEDIAN(A1:An)

### Mode
Most frequently occurring value in a range of numbers
=MODE(A1:An)

### Min
Smallest value in a range of numbers
=MIN(A1:An)

### Max
Largest value in a range of numbers
=MAX(A1:An)

### Range
The difference between the Max and the Min.  Not an Excel function; you must calculate it yourself.
=MAX(A1:An)-MIN(A1:An)
